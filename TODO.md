# Ai Command Palette

Below you'll find a list of potential new features, needed fixes, issues, and anything else I think I might want to do with this project. ✌️

The format is based on [TODO.md](https://github.com/todomd/todo.md)

### Todo

- [ ] file/folder bookmarks: allow users to save 'bookmarks' to commonly used files and folders, the use the File.execute() method to open them up.
- [ ] startup screens customization: Allow the user to set what shows up when the command palette is first opened. Could be favorite commands, workflows, etc.
- [ ] sort filtered items by most used: Track command usage counts in the user settings file, and use that count in the scoring algorithm for sorting the palette items.
- [ ] store command history: Store the last 50 or 100 commands in the user settings file, then allow them to scroll up and down through them when the command palette is first presented (and no text has been entered).

### Doing

- [ ] new built-in commands: add new commands available to the api and not already accessible via the menu system

### Done

- [x] goto functionality: goto artboard, goto named object [(commit 0ad82b4)](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette/commit/0ad82b4f250d49ebe5a0aacf87e7bd77bc4f46c0)
